# VBA-Email
Pulls elements from cells to create email with template 
Currently working on improving it by adding a user form with a send email button. Might be able to improve by getting rid of template and using a merged cell in place of it
That way I can actually make the template dynamic instead of having to manually edit it everytime. 
Also looking to make a script that can automatically pull file locations based on client name
